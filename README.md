# Weather-data-analysis-power_query-mother_duck-power_bi
This project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow, including **data cleaning**, **transformation**, and **visualization** using **Power Query**, **MotherDuck (SQL)**, and **Power BI**.  
The dataset (weatherHistory.csv) was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rafunlearnhub/weatherhistory/data).

## 🧮 SQL Analysis

Ten analytical **SELECT** queries were created in MotherDuck to explore weather patterns:  
1. Number of records by precipitation type  
2. Average temperature by weather condition  
3. Average yearly temperature (2006–2016)  
4. Average temperature by year and month  
5. Average humidity by weather condition  
6. Average temperature and humidity by weather condition  
7. Min and max yearly temperatures (2006–2016)  
8. Average visibility by weather condition  
9. Average comfort gap by month  
10. Average temperature by hour of day  

Each query result was exported to CSV for visualization in Power BI.

## 📊 Power BI Visualization

The Power BI report presents key insights into temperature, humidity, and precipitation trends between 2006 and 2016.  
The visualizations are included in a separate Power BI file.
